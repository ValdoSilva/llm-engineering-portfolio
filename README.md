# LLM Engineering Portfolio

Hello! I'm Osvaldo N X da Silva, an aspiring LLM Engineer. This repository is a curated collection of projects I've built while mastering Large Language Models, AI Agents, and related technologies.

## üéì Learning Journey: LLM Engineering Mastery

I'm currently mastering LLM Engineering through a comprehensive curriculum that covers:

**Core Competencies:**
- **Foundation Models & Transformers** - Understanding architecture and model selection
- **Multi-Modal Chatbots** - Building interactive AI applications with Gradio UI
- **Open-Source AI Solutions** - Leveraging HuggingFace for automated systems
- **RAG Systems** - Advanced retrieval with vector embeddings and LangChain
- **Model Fine-Tuning** - Specialized training with LoRA/QLoRA techniques
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Building collaborative autonomous AI agents

**Technical Skills Developed:**
- Model evaluation and benchmarking for business applications
- Vector database integration and embedding strategies
- AI agent development and tool integration
- Cost-effective model optimization and deployment
- End-to-end LLM product development

*This structured learning path provides hands-on experience with both proprietary and open-source models, preparing me for real-world LLM engineering challenges.*

## üöÄ Skills Demonstrated

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompts.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Building systems that combine LLMs with external knowledge bases.
*   **AI Agents:** Developing autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute tasks using tools.
*   **Model Fine-Tuning:** Optimizing LLMs for specific tasks using LoRA/QLoRA techniques.
*   **Frameworks & Tools:** Hands-on experience with LangChain, HuggingFace, OpenAI API, Vector Databases, and Gradio.
*   **Programming:** Python, API Integration, Data Handling, Model Evaluation.

## üìÅ Project Portfolio

Here are the projects I've completed, listed in order of increasing complexity.

### Project 1: Advanced Document Q&A with RAG
*   **Description:** A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that allows users to ask questions about their own documents (PDF, TXT). It chunks text, creates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and retrieves relevant context to generate accurate answers.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenAI GPT-4, LangChain, FAISS, Sentence Transformers.
*   **Key Learnings:** Text chunking strategies, embedding models, vector similarity search, managing conversation history.

### Project 2: Multi-Tool AI Agent
*   **Description:** An autonomous AI agent that can use tools (like a calculator, web search API, and filesystem) to accomplish user-defined tasks. The agent reasons through a problem, selects the right tool, and iterates until the goal is achieved.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, LangChain Agents & Tools, SerpAPI (for search), OpenAI.
*   **Key Learnings:** Agent reasoning loops, tool creation, error handling in autonomous systems.

### Project 3: Fine-Tuned Domain-Specific Model
*   **Description:** Fine-tuned an open-source language model using LoRA/QLoRA for a specific domain task, demonstrating cost-effective specialization compared to large frontier models.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, HuggingFace Transformers, PEFT, LoRA/QLoRA, Weights & Biases.
*   **Key Learnings:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning, training loops, model evaluation, deployment considerations.
*   `[Link to Project Folder]`

### Project 4: Multi-Agent Collaboration System
*   **Description:** Built a system where multiple AI agents specialize in different tasks and collaborate to solve complex problems, simulating real-world team dynamics.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, LangGraph, OpenAI, Custom Tools.
*   **Key Learnings:** Agent orchestration, communication protocols, task decomposition, system design.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run These Projects

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with specific setup instructions. Generally, you will need:

1.  Python 3.8+
2.  Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Set up your environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) in a `.env` file.
